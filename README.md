# Minitalk

Minitalk is a project of 42.
It's goal is to create a server and a client. Server at the start prints it's process identification (PID) and then waits for the client to send a message. 
Client needs server PID and then the user can send a message which is then translated into binary and sent to the server with the help of two signals representing 0s and 1s.
Message then gets recontructed back to characters and is being printed onto terminal window.
Code is written in C.
